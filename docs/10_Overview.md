# SIGHUP Tomcat Template

`SIGHUP's Tomcat Template` allows you to kickstart a new Tomcat service using the [SIGHUP Secure Container](https://sighup.io/secure-containers/) images.

Secure Containers are security-focused images that are built on top of the official docker images, enriched with Kubernetes integrations and continously scanned and patched by SIGHUP.

IMPORTANT NOTE: [SIGHUP Secure Containers](https://sighup.io/secure-containers/) require a separate subscription. Please get in touch if you want to know more.
